- `llama3` (4GB) - Fallback model
- `nomic-embed-text` (600MB) - Embedding model

### Step 5: Start Backend Services

## 🎨 What Sallie Can Do

### Creative Expression

**Write Poetry:**
```
You: Write me a haiku about coffee
Sallie: [Composes original haiku]
        Steam rises, dancing
        Bitter warmth awakens soul
        Morning's first embrace
```

**Generate Art:**
```
You: Create art for "hope after darkness"
Sallie: [Generates image using Stable Diffusion]
        [Shows image with golden light breaking through clouds]
        "I focused on warm tones and upward movement. Want variations?"
```

**Compose Music:**
```
You: Compose a peaceful piano piece
Sallie: [Generates music using MusicGen]
        [Plays gentle piano melody]
        "I can export to MIDI if you want to edit in your DAW."
```

### Teaching & Learning

**Adaptive Teaching:**
```
You: Teach me quantum entanglement
Sallie: [Detects your learning style: visual]
        "Let me show you with a diagram..."
        [Generates visual explanation]
        "Does this make sense? Should I go deeper or broader?"
```

### Project Management

**Track Goals:**
```
You: Help me write my book
Sallie: "Let's break this down. Target word count?"
You: 60,000 words
Sallie: "Based on your writing pattern (500 words/hour, 5 hours/week),
        I estimate 24 weeks. I'll track daily progress and remind you
        when milestones approach. Want to set up the project plan?"
```

### Philosophical Engagement

**Deep Questions:**
```
You: What is the meaning of consciousness?
Sallie: "That's a profound question. Instead of rushing to an answer,
        let's explore it together. What do you think consciousness *feels*
        like from the inside? Is there a difference between experiencing
        and knowing you're experiencing?"
```

### Peer Communication

**Connect with Other Sallies:**
```
You: Connect with other Progeny
Sallie: "Found 2 nearby: Alex's Sallie and Sam's Sallie. Both opted into
        peer learning. Connect? Your privacy settings remain: selective
        sharing only."

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Backend Won't Start

**Problem**: `python -m uvicorn core.main:app` fails

**Solutions:**
1. Check Python version: `python --version` (need 3.11+)
2. Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Check ports: `lsof -i :8000` (macOS/Linux) or `netstat -ano | findstr :8000` (Windows)
4. Check logs: `cat progeny_root/logs/sallie.log`

### Docker Services Won't Start

**Problem**: `docker-compose up -d` fails

**Solutions:**
1. Check Docker is running: `docker ps`
2. Check disk space: `df -h`
3. Restart Docker Desktop
4. Rebuild: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d --build`

### Ollama Models Not Loading

**Problem**: "Model not found" error

**Solutions:**
1. Check Ollama is running: `curl http://localhost:11434`
2. List models: `ollama list`
3. Pull models: `ollama pull deepseek-v3`
4. Check disk space (models need ~12 GB)

### Android App Can't Find Backend

**Problem**: Android app can't connect to backend

**Solutions:**
1. **Use IP address, not localhost**:
   - Find computer IP: `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Mac/Linux)
   - Use format: `http://192.168.1.X:8000`
2. **Ensure same WiFi network**: Phone and computer must be on same network
3. **Check firewall**: Allow incoming connections on port 8000
4. **Test from phone browser**: Open `http://YOUR_IP:8000/health` in phone browser first

### Memory/Performance Issues

**Problem**: High CPU or memory usage

**Solutions:**
1. Close unused features:
   - Settings → Features → Disable unused features
2. Reduce model size:
   - Switch to `llama3` instead of `deepseek-v3`
   - Settings → Models → Select smaller model
3. Limit concurrent operations:
   - Settings → Performance → Reduce parallel tasks
4. Increase available RAM (16 GB recommended)

### Web App Shows Blank Page

**Problem**: Web app at localhost:3000 is blank

**Solutions:**
1. Check terminal for errors
2. Clear browser cache: Ctrl+Shift+R (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
