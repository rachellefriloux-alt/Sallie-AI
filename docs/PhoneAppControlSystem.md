## Security & Privacy

The system implements a robust permission model with runtime consent:

1. Each capability requires specific permissions (APP_LAUNCH, APP_CONTROL, etc.)
2. Permissions are requested from the user at runtime
3. All actions and content access are logged and can be audited
4. The user can revoke permissions at any time

Sallie can extract various types of content:

1. **Text**: Extract text content from apps
2. **Media**: Access images, videos, and audio
3. **Data**: Extract structured data from apps
4. **UI Structure**: Analyze the UI hierarchy
5. **Contacts**: Access contact information
6. **Messages**: Access message content

### Automation

The automation system enables complex workflows:

1. **Cross-app workflows**: Define sequences of actions across multiple apps
2. **Conditional steps**: Add conditions and decision points
3. **Wait conditions**: Add delays or wait for specific events
4. **Error handling**: Retry failed steps or provide alternatives

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced AI integration**: Use AI to better understand app UIs and content
2. **Advanced pattern recognition**: Improve the ability to recognize UI patterns
3. **Personalized workflows**: Learn from user behaviors to suggest workflows
4. **Extended app support**: Improve compatibility with a wider range of apps
5. **Voice control integration**: Combine with voice commands for hands-free operation

## Conclusion

The Phone App Control system provides Sallie with comprehensive capabilities to interact with applications on the user's device. This enables Sallie to assist the user more effectively by directly interacting with apps, extracting relevant information, and automating common tasks, all while maintaining strong security and privacy controls.
